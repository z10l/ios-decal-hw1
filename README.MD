## Due
Wednesday, September 16 at 11:59 PM

## Description
In Homework 1, you will be debugging Swift code inside a Playground. Xcode Playgrounds are a great place to test out the effects of certain lines of code and to just play around without having to create entire new projects. They also give very useful information that can make debugging easy. Let the compiler be your guide. Be mindful of its suggestions, warnings, and errors.

## Instructions
1. Fork the assignment's repository from (https://github.com/iosdecal).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine (the URL should contain YOUR_USERNAME/ios-decal-..).
3. **Debug debugging.playground.**
4. Add, commit, and push your modified file(s) to your forked remote repository.
